devgoogle-django
================

An important part of being a good developer is being able to find the answers to your questions.  You don't need to know everytihng, but you do need to be able to find help when you need it.  #devgoogle was created to show beginners that even the best have to resort to Google sometimes.

The original Twitter hashtag #devgoogle was started by [Lyzi Diamond](https://twitter.com/lyzidiamond).  I loved the idea and thought it would be a great excuse to learn the basics of Django.
